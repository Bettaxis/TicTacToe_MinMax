Plays best in 1920x1080, but can be played at any resolution. 

Use Mouse cursor to select to start as either the X or O player.

Human player will always be the BLUE X or O. 
AI player will always be the RED X or O.
X player will always go first as requested in the assignment PDF.

Click the translucent boxes to place your X or O. Try to win! (Spoilers, you can't!)

Reset Game button clears the board and allows you to try again!

Enjoy the Chrono Trigger muzak sourced from OCREMIX.

NOTE: If you choose to play as the O player and IMMEDIATELY click a space(<half a second), it will appear as if the X player has taken two turns,
this is due to the initial delay when generating the tree but it is only a visual. I did not want to implement a forced delay to mitigate this as that 
could appear to be a prolonged AI decision/generation. 

It is merely the first X turn and second X turn appearing right after your first O, but the AI is waiting for your next turn.
